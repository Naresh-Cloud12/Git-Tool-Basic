# Git-Tool-Basic

First we need to download git sme then initialize that using "git init" command

Now lets create a folder and create a file ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4032ffc7-f3b1-473e-8771-fb5461e6a1a6)
now for keep versioning or want to share the code for that we need to create a git repository ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb91a22a-b9d0-4f96-8c1e-a114761c98a4)
for check git repository create use the command -- (ls -la) it will show a hidden folder and the .git it will tracks everything.
everything git is tracked as it will be in Objects ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e83fd7b3-2d64-4863-904c-0de36f39089a)
hooks check the ss --so if anyone uninterntiionally create password or api tokens so with that we can prevent.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642fd71d-fe81-4783-a778-00cd0aab9edf) it was untracket so for that we need to tell git to track the file or not for that command --- git add followed by the file name.now clear so if anyone or u making any changes in the file.for that if u check the status it will show whatever it was changed if want the exact changes for that command-- git diff.
If u want to version1,2,3 like that we need to give command once u done the file--git commit. So now if anyone changes when anyone made changes it will show command - git logs
How do u share this code--there is one distributed system so we have to create one distributed system GitHub or Self Hosted or bitBucket
